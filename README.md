## Task

Using the API endpoint https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos develop a single page photo gallery. It is up to you how you implement the design, however we would like the full size image to appear in a modal when you click the thumbnail. The project must use React with a webpack config. You may use either NPM or Yarn. You may use either TS or ECMA. You must provide one example of a tested component using Jest.
